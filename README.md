## Prompt-Engineering-Tool-Collections

With the rise of ChatGPT and some large generative models, the emergence of COT (Chain-of-thought) and rapid improvement in few-shot learning performance has created a new way to develop tools. By providing prompts to large models such as GPT3 or GPT3.5, specific tasks can be completed, such as translation, proofreading, summarization, code enhancement, command line prompts etc. This repository is made for a summary and classification for self-learning and research purposes as well as sharing with everyone. Only for open source project.
